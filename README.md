# Flashback — MTGO Replay System

A passive replay system for Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO) that captures network packets during live games, decodes them into structured events, and stores compact replay logs. Includes a web-based viewer for stepping through replays with visual board representation.

## Overview

**Flashback** consists of three main components:

- **Capture Agent** (Rust) - Runs on Windows alongside MTGO, sniffing packets and decoding the protocol
- **Decode Pipeline** (Rust) - Converts raw captured streams into structured replay files
- **Web Viewer** (TypeScript + React) - Loads replay files, reconstructs board state, and renders an interactive game view

### Goals

- Passively capture MTGO game data via packet sniffing (no game modification)
- Decode MTGO's network protocol into structured, human-readable game events
- Store replays as compact action logs from which full board state can be reconstructed
- Provide a web-based replay viewer with zone layout and card images
- Capture individual games as separate replay files

### Non-Goals

- Chat log capture
- Match-level grouping (Bo3 as a unit)
- Replay sharing / upload / hosted service
- Format-aware features (legality, archetypes)
- Full graphical fidelity / animations resembling MTGO's UI
- Mobile support

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows** for capture agent (requires npcap)
- **Rust** 1.70+ for building the capture agent and decoder
- **Node.js** 18+ for building the web viewer
- **npm** for managing web dependencies

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mtgo-replay-omp

# Rust (capture agent + decoder)
cargo build --release

# Web viewer
cd web
npm install
```

### Usage

#### Capturing Traffic

1. Install [npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) on Windows
2. Run the capture agent with administrative privileges:

```bash
flashback <interface> <output_file>
```

3. Play MTGO while the capture agent is running
4. Press Ctrl+C to stop capture

#### Decoding Replays

Convert a captured stream into a `.flashback` replay file:

```bash
cargo run --bin decode -- <stream_file> --output my_game.flashback

# Just show opcode statistics:
cargo run --bin decode -- <stream_file> --stats-only
```

#### Viewing Replays

1. Start the web viewer:

```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
3. Load a `.flashback` or `.json` file (drag-and-drop or file picker)
4. Use controls to step through the replay:
   - Forward/backward buttons or slider to navigate
   - Play/Pause for automatic playback
   - Speed controls (0.25x to 4x)

```

### Decode Pipeline

The decoder transforms raw MTGO traffic through six layers:

| Layer | Module | Input | Output |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. Framing | `framing.rs` | Raw TCP bytes | `RawMessage` (opcode + payload) |
| 2. FLS Envelope | `fls.rs` | `RawMessage` | `FlsMessage` (GsMessage, GameStatusChange, etc.) |
| 3. Game Messages | `game_messages.rs` | Inner `meta` bytes | `GameMessage` (GamePlayStatus, GameOver, etc.) |
| 4. StateBuf | `statebuf.rs` | Raw state buffer | Assembled bytes (with diff + checksum) |
| 5. State Elements | `statebuf.rs` | Assembled bytes | `Vec<StateElement>` (Things, PlayerStatus, TurnStep) |
| 6. Translation | `state.rs` + `translator.rs` | State diffs | `Vec<ReplayAction>` |

### Action Types

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DrawCard` | Card moved from library to hand |
| `PlayLand` | Land played from hand to battlefield (never touched stack) |
| `CastSpell` | Spell cast (appeared on stack from hand) |
| `ActivateAbility` | Ability activated (new object on stack with SRC_THING_ID) |
| `Resolve` | Spell/ability left the stack |
| `ZoneTransition` | Card moved between zones |
| `Attack` | Creature declared as attacker |
| `Block` | Creature declared as blocker |
| `LifeChange` | Player life total changed |
| `TapPermanent` / `UntapPermanent` | Tap state changed |
| `DamageMarked` | Damage marked on creature |
| `SummoningSickness` | Summoning sickness state changed |
| `FaceDown` / `FaceUp` | Face-down state changed |
| `Attach` / `Detach` | Equipment/aura attachment changed |
| `CounterUpdate` | Counter count changed (+1/+1, loyalty, etc.) |
| `PowerToughnessUpdate` | P/T changed |
| `Discard` | Card discarded from hand |
| `Mill` | Card milled from library to graveyard |
| `CreateToken` | Token created on the battlefield |
| `TurnChange` | New turn started |
| `PhaseChange` | Game phase changed |

### Phases

`untap`, `upkeep`, `draw`, `precombat_main`, `begin_combat`, `declare_attackers`, `declare_blockers`, `combat_damage`, `end_of_combat`, `postcombat_main`, `end_of_turn`, `cleanup`

## Current Status

### What Works

- **Full decode pipeline**: raw MTGO stream -> framing -> FLS -> game messages -> StateBuf -> state -> actions -> JSON
- **Golden file validation**: 12MB capture (10,195 messages) decodes to 623 actions across a 3-game Modern Bo3 match
- **Multi-game support**: per-game replay schema (v2.0) with game selector UI
- **Web viewer**: loads .flashback files, reconstructs board state, renders zones/cards/life totals, step-through controls with playback speed
- **23+ action types** decoded from state diffs (including Discard, Mill, CreateToken)
- **Card name resolution** via Scryfall API (~99% coverage)
- **Chat-driven enrichment**: player names, turn tracking, and zone resolution extracted from MTGO chat logs
- **Phase deduplication**: PhaseChange events deduplicated at source
